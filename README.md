- Adds a torch that can be held in one hand, and can be placed at a smaller range than the matter manipulator
- Changes the bare-hands torch recipe into a handheld torch, and adds two recipes to change a handheld torch into a "real" torch and vice versa
- Placed torches will spawn handheld torches when broken


Based on an idea from Kizuna
